# Embark 

We have analyzed that since this revolution of blockchain has begun not a lot of people have the correct amount of knowledge to get on the Web3 train. The protocols, the different blockchain ecosystems and their websites are too sophisticated for the common public. What is required is a platform that is beginner-friendly, helps them understand the concepts, rewards them to learn and looks really awesome.
We built Embark keeping this in mind. It's fast, its UI is self intuitive and helps people educate and enhance the crypto literacy rate of the audience. 
The functionalities of Embark are: 
- It provides a Newsletter where people can subscribe to the weekly crypto news 
- Embark has its own ERC20 Token which people can earn by giving a quiz at the end of the newsletter 
- Everyone who subscribes to the letter is given a randomly generated NFT from our collection "Moody Gorillas Club"
- It has an integrated easy to use decentralized exchange on 3 different chains powered by 1inch.
- There is a dedicated page for daily crypto news where people can read articles and educate themselves. 
- A lighting NFT Minter that is easy to use and is decentralized. We are using IPFS to store the metadata and smart contract mints it on the chain.
